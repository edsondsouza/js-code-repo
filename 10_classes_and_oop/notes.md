# Javascript and Classes

## Does javascript have classes?
Technically NO. Back then it was not there and even today Javascript does not have classes. Because Javascript is a prototype-based-language. Classes in javascript is syntactic-sugar. Classes were introduced so that developers are not felt missed out. JS is not oopl, not functional programming language rather it is a **Prototype-based-language**.

Yes, JavaScript introduced the concept of classes in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). Classes in JavaScript provide a more structured and familiar way to create objects and deal with inheritance. However, behind the scenes, JavaScript's classes are primarily syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model.

JavaScript classes allow you to define a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods. They offer a more conventional syntax similar to class systems in other programming languages like Java or Python. Under the hood, classes in JavaScript are still using prototypes for inheritance.

## OOP
- Programming paradigm

## Objects
- Collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase, Promises

## Why use OOP?
- to prevent **Spaghetti code**
- Spaghetti code is the general term used for any source code that's hard to understand because it has no defined structure.

## Parts of OOP
Object Literals {}

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars (learn from chatGPT with examples)
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
